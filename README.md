# PSEC-assignment
A quiz system that is similar to Blackboard Quiz except coded in Python for one of my modules called Programming in Security (PSEC). In this project, I learnt socket programming as well as client-server programming which was fairly interesting.   
    
[Note] The documentation of the project is relatively scuffed, there might need to be a rework on it in the future.
